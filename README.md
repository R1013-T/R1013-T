## 😎 Hobbies

- 🌍 I love travelling and exploring new places. Each journey brings me new perspectives and experiences.
- 🛍️ Shopping is another hobby I enjoy, as it allows me to stay updated with the latest trends and technology.
- 📚 I'm fond of reading books. However, they seem to double as a sleeping aid, as I often find myself drifting off mid-chapter!
- 🏂 When it's winter, you can often find me snowboarding. The thrill and excitement of this sport keep me looking forward to every winter season.
